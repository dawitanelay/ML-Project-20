# University of Pisa Machine Learning Project 2020

### Abstract

Our goal was to build and compare different models from different software tools. We compare a
Neural Network from Keras [1] and both a Support Vector Machine and a K-nn regressors from the
Scikit-learn [2] framework. We perform model selection and validate via a combination of screening
phases and cross-validation, also testing on an internal test set extracted via hold-out.
