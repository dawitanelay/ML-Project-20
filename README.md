# University of Pisa Machine Learning Project 2020

### Abstract

Our goal was to build and compare different models from different software tools. We compare a
Neural Network from Keras [1] and both a Support Vector Machine and a K-nn regressors from the
Scikit-learn [2] framework. We perform model selection and validate via a combination of screening
phases and cross-validation, also testing on an internal test set extracted via hold-out.

### Introduction

The aims of project B of the Machine Learning (ML) course held by Professor Alessio Micheli at [Department of Computer Science](https://di.unipi.it/) of [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/) is to bulid a ML model simulator to solve a multi-target regression task on CUP Dataset provided by the professor and Make a comparison among models .After exploring diffrent models
